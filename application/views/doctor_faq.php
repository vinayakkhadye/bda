  Why is BDA providing a FREE service?
  <p>BDA.com believes that the best model in helping patients find the right Doctors is if we are completely unbiased to the Doctor – We therefore do not take any material consideration to list / influence ranking of the Doctor.However we do make money on advertisements. We show ads but our search results are completely unbiased.</p>
  </li>

	<li>
  What is the procedure for getting listed on BDA.com?
  <p>Please logon to <a href="http://www.bookdrappointment.com">www.bookdrappointment.com</a> and just follow the login process.</p>
  </li>
  
  <li>
  I never asked to be listed but I am still listed on BDA.com without any prior notification. Why?
  <p>We at BDA.com have field and data teams that search for and find out the top doctors in any locality and gather information on them so that they can be listed on our website. In all cases we call or visit the Clinic / Doctor and verify the details thus collected. In your particular
case we would have spoken to a staff member at your clinic.</p>
  <p>In case you don’t want to be listed – Please do drop us a line at support@bookdrappointment.com and we will have one of our senior
  team members speak to you and explain. If you still want to go ahead and delist – please let the team member know when they speak
  to you and we will delist you immediately.</p>
